# Adaptive Resonance Theory (A.R.T.)
The fuzzy variants - Fuzzy ART and Fuzzy ARTMAP - augmented by an autoencoder network, are used here to perform unsupervised and supervised learning respectively to solve a simple image recognition problem. The dataset used is the MNIST image set of handwritten digits.
